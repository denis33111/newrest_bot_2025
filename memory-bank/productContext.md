# Product Context - NewRest Bot 2025

## Why This Project Exists
The NewRest Bot addresses the critical need for efficient worker management in the hospitality/restaurant industry, specifically for temporary or seasonal workers who need:
- Streamlined registration processes
- Real-time attendance tracking
- Document verification workflows
- Multi-language support for diverse workforces

## Problems It Solves

### 1. **Manual Registration Bottlenecks**
- **Problem**: Paper-based registration forms are slow, error-prone, and difficult to track
- **Solution**: Digital registration flow with real-time validation and immediate data capture

### 2. **Attendance Tracking Chaos**
- **Problem**: Manual attendance sheets are easily lost, duplicated, or inaccurate
- **Solution**: Automated daily tracking with Google Sheets integration and real-time updates

### 3. **Document Management Issues**
- **Problem**: Critical documents (AMKA, AFM, health certificates) are often missing or expired
- **Solution**: Centralized document tracking with status monitoring and reminder systems

### 4. **Language Barriers**
- **Problem**: Multi-national workforce creates communication challenges
- **Solution**: Bilingual interface (Greek/English) with localized content

## How It Should Work
